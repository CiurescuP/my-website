# my-website
Hello! Thank you for taking the time to look over my website. I know I have a long way to go when it comes to Web Development, but as a very ambitious person, I am positive that with the right work environment I can achieve my goals. With consistency in my professional life, I'm positive I can become my best-self and only improve as a Web Developer. Even though I have finished my portfolio, I am still searching for ways to improve my skills, creating other projects, big or small, and learning new things. Like React, or getting into Leetcode. 
Thank you, again!
